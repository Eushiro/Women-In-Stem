let ChienShiungWu = """
Chien-Shiung Wu was born in a small town near Shanghai, China. Her father encouraged her passion for science from a young age, surrounding her with books, magazines, and newspapers at a time when education for girls was not widely supported.

Following her graduation from National Central University in Shanghai, Wu was encouraged to pursue further education in America by a research supervisor who had done the same. At first, she planned to attend the University of Michigan; however, when she heard that women were not even allowed to use the front entrance, Wu changed her plans and enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley.

After completing her PhD at Berkeley, Wu joined the Manhattan project, a research project focused on the development of nuclear weaponry during World War 2. Wu made significant contributions on the topic of beta decay, the process in which one element changes into another element. In fact, during this time, she was approached by physicists Tsung Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang to help prove a theory that they were working on. Wu’s experiments were crucial to the confirmation of their theory, but she was not, unfortunately, acknowledged when they received the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics. Wu continued to make significant contributions throughout her life, going on to win many awards and honors, including the National Medal of Science, the Comstock Prize, and the Wolf Prize in Physics in 1978.

let EdnaPaisano = """
Edna Paisano was born on the Native American reservation of Nez Percé, in Sweetwater, Idaho. Living on the reserve and owning the fishing, hunting, and mineral rights to the land made it possible for Paisano to preserve her family’s culture; they regularly prepared, dried, and smoked the meat of deer, elk, and moose in their backyard. After high school, following the example of her mother, an accomplished special education teacher awarded by the National Educational Association, Paisano pursued a post-secondary education at the University of Washington.

In 1976, Paisano was imprisoned for trying to persuade the US government to return the land of Fort Lawton - legally Native American land - to Indignous people. Nevertheless, years later, she was able to work at the United States Census Bureau on issues related to Alaska Native Americans. This made her the first Indigenous woman to obtain a full time position at the Bureau.

After examining the 1980 census, Paisano discovered that the data from certain geographical locations was inaccurate. Census figures are an important factor in the allocation of federal funds; inaccurate data can prevent funds from going where they are needed. Paisano used her knowledge of modern statistical techniques to improve the accuracy of these censuses, using branches of mathematics including demographics, statistics, and computer programming. As a result of her work, there was a 38% increase in Native Americans recorded residing in the United States in the 1990 census.
"""

let MaryRoss = """
Mary G. Ross grew up in a household that prioritized the cultural heritage of her Cherokee people - one where equal education for boys and girls was emphasized. Through the support of her community, Ross enrolled at Northeastern State Teacher’s College at the age of 16 and graduated with a degree in mathematics. She then worked as a statistician for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and taught science and math in rural Oklahoma before pursuing a master’s degree at the Colorado State College of Education.

Ross joined Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in 1942, where she became an integral part of a team known as Skunk Works. Skunk Works was a team of 40 engineers who worked on designing aircrafts to be used for interplanetary space travel, earth-orbiting flights, and satellites conceived for both defense and civilian purposes. Ross was not only the sole woman on the team, but also the only Native American. Unfortunately, much of her work at Lockheed remains unknown as it was, and still is, classified.

Over the years, Ross also helped write NASA’s Planetary Flight Handbook, the agency’s guide to space travel to Mars and Venus.

let GertrudeElion = """
Gertrude B. Elion was born in New York City to Robert Elion, a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant, and Bertha Cohen, a Polish immigrant. Her father had a dental practice and provided for the family; however, after having invested heavily in the stock market, her family lost the majority of their wealth in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Fortunately, she was able to attend Hunter College for free due to her good grades.

After graduating from Hunter College, jobs were scarce and the few laboratory positions available were not accessible to women. Fortunately, following the shortage of chemists during World War II, she was able to get a job in a laboratory. However, it was not a job doing research - she did analytical quality control work for a major food company. After more than a year at this job, Elion left the position - she felt that it was too repetitive and that she was no longer learning anything. Instead, she took a position as a research assistant to George Hitchings.

In Dr. Hitchings’ laboratory, Elion helped develop drugs to treat leukemia and prevent kidney transplant rejection. Using an innovative new method, she helped design a drug that was able to successfully interfere with cell growth, allowing leukemia, gout, malaria, and a variety of other illnesses to be treated. She went on to win the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this discovery, sharing the award with George H. Hitchings and Sir James Black. In her lifetime, Elion developed 45 different patents for her discoveries medicine.
"""

let GertyCori = """
Gerty Cori was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia to Otto Radnitz and Martha Neustadt. She was encouraged to attend medical school by her uncle, a professor of pediatrics, and decided to attend the German University of Prague, a school that only had a few female students. She graduated with her M.D. degree in 1920.

Cori met husband Carl in her first year and, after graduation, the couple moved to Vienna and married. Despite holding the same degree and having the same research experience, Carl was able to work at the University of Vienna’s medical clinic and Pharmacological Institute while Gerty could only work as an assistant at the Karolinen Children’s hospital because of her gender. Likewise, in 1922, Carl accepted a biochemistry position at the State Institute for the Study of Malignant Disease in Buffalo, NY while Gerty was forced to take a lower level position as assistant pathologist.

Their joint work began three years later, and in 1929, they proposed the theory that bears their name and later won them a Nobel Prize. The "Cori cycle" explains how energy moves in the body. It illustrates how glycogen, found in the muscles, can be broken down to glucose when energy is needed. It further explains how this glucose can be converted to lactic acid before being converted back to glycogen by the liver to be stored again. Their Cori cycle was incredibly important in terms not only because it was the first time the cycle of carbohydrates in the human body had been fully understood and explained, but also because it aided in the elucidation of possible treatments for diabetes.
"""

let RitaLeviMontalcini = """
Rita Levi-Montalcini was born in Turin, Italy, to a father who strongly opposed women’s education beyond finishing school - in other words, school that taught etiquette and social graces rather than scholarship and academics. However, this attitude only encouraged Levi-Montalcini’s ambitions. At 20, she realized that she did not want to conform to the role her father expected of her and asked for permission to engage in a professional career.

Levi-Montalcini began her studies in neurology and psychology, however, following Mussolini’s newly published 1938 Race Laws forbidding non-Aryans from having professional or academic careers, she was kicked out of school. Levi-Montalcini then travelled to Brussels for a short time to study at a neurological institute, but had to flee when Germany was poised to invade Belgium. Back in Turin, Levi-Montalcini built a laboratory in her bedroom, fashioning scalpels from sewing needles, using an ophthalmologist’s tiny scissors, and repurposing a watchmaker’s forceps. With these tools and inspired by an article she read by embryologist Viktor Hamburger, she dissected chick embryos and studied their motor neurons under a microscope.

Levi-Montalcini was then able to work with Hamburger. Following the discovery that when implanted into chick embryos, the mouse tumours spurred nerve growth, Levi-Montalcini and Hamburger traced the effect to what they eventually went on to name nerve-growth factor (NGF). With biochemist Stanley Cohen, who isolated the NGF from the tumour, Levi-Montalcini shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1986.
"""

let RupaFurdoonji = """
Rupa Bai Furdoonji began her studies in 1885 by being one of the few women to enrol in medical courses at Hyderabad Medical College. Hyderabad was the capital city of a state in the south of India during a time of British rule. Fortunately, Hyderabad was also the city in which Surgeon Major Edward Lawrie took charge as chief surgeon of Afzalgunj hospital as well as Hyderabad Medical College. Not only did he allow five women to enroll in medical courses, unheard of at the time, but Laurie also popularised chloroform anaesthesia and made his students proficient in administering it.

Unfortunately, teachers at the medical school were Englishmen and their lectures were in English. Only by having an Urdu translator was Furdoonji able to obtain a degree of ‘hakeem’ - equivalent to that of a medical doctor today.

Furdoonji then worked as a hospital anaesthesiologist where she administered chloroform. In 1909, she studied physics and chemistry at Edinburgh before going on to earn a doctorate at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and retiring in 1920.
"""

let AnandiGopalJoshi = """
Anandibai was born in India to an orthodox Hindu family. As was common at the time, she was married at the age of nine to Gopalrao Joshi, a widower almost twenty years her senior, due to pressure laid by her family. After marriage, her husband renamed her Anandi.

Fortunately, Gopalrao was a progressive thinker and supported education for women - a view that was not very prevalent at the time. He noticed Anandibai's interest in pursuing academics and helped her not only receive an education but also learn English. She eventually became inspired to become a physician after, at the age of fourteen, Anandibai gave birth to a boy that lived only for ten days.

Anandibai began her medical education in the United States at the age of 19. However, in America, her declining health worsened because of the cold weather and unfamiliar diet and she contracted tuberculosis. She was nevertheless able to graduate with a medical degree with a thesis entitled "Obstetrics among the Aryan Hindoos", and on her graduation, Queen Victoria sent her a congratulatory message. Anandibai later returned to her home in India to become the physician-in-charge of the female ward of Albert Edward Hospital.
"""

let CeciliaPayne = """
Cecilia Helena Payne was one of three children born in Wendover, England, to Emma Leonora Helena and Edward John Payne. Unfortunately, Payne's father died when she was only four years old, and her mother was forced to raise Payne and her siblings on her own.

In 1919, Payne received a scholarship to study at Newnham College, Cambridge University, where she chose to pursue botany, physics, and chemistry. Although she completed her studies, she was not awarded a degree because of her gender - Cambridge did not grant degrees to women until decades later in 1948. In 1923, she was offered a fellowship to study at the Harvard College Observatory. Like Cambridge, Harvard did not grant doctoral degrees to women; Payne therefore received the first Ph.D. in astronomy from Radcliffe College for her thesis.

Payne’s thesis was revolutionary - it went against widely accepted scientific consensus at the time by establishing hydrogen as the overwhelming constituent of the stars, and thus, the most abundant element in the universe. It further established that stars could be classified according to their temperatures.

On completing her doctorate, she spent years completing low-paid duties as at the time, advancement to professor was denied to women at Harvard. Only in 1956 was Payne allowed to further advance in her career; she became the first female professor and the first woman to become department chair at Harvard.
"""

let AnnieCannon = """
Annie Jump Cannon was the eldest child born to Senator Wilson Cannon and wife Mary Jump. Cannon credits her interest in astronomy to her mother’s teaching of the constellations as a child.

Cannon was one of the first Delaware women to enroll in college; she studied physics and astronomy at Wellesley College, one of the top schools for women at the time. Unfortunately, Cannon had become almost completely deaf, likely due to a case of scarlet fever. Nonetheless, she graduated with a degree in physics in 1884 before returning to her home of Dover, Delaware.

In 1896, Cannon became an assistant at the Harvard Observatory. As she began working, Cannon found the conventional systems of star classification to be ineffective for her purposes. At Harvard, the spectra of stars had been sorted into groups that followed alphabetical order (A, B, C, and so on). Cannon rearranged groups, omitted some letters, added a few, and made new subdivisions, ultimately creating her own spectral division, the simplified classes O, B, A, F, G, K, M. Cannon’s system was adopted as the universal standard to be utilized by astronomers for generations.

let BessieColeman = """
Bessie was born as one of 13 children to Susan and George Coleman. Her father, who was of Native American and African American descent, left the family in search of better opportunities in Oklahoma when Bessie was only a young child. After graduating from the Missionary Baptist Church in Texas, she attended the Oklahoma Colored Agricultural and Normal University (Langston University). She was only able to complete one term, however, due to inadequate financial resources. A few years later, she was inspired to pursue aviation after hearing stories of World War I pilots.

Seeing as flying schools in the United States did not allow women to be admitted, Coleman took on the task of learning French and applying to flying schools in France. After only seven months, Coleman earned her license from France's Caudron Brother's School of Aviation, becoming the world’s first black woman to earn a pilot’s licence.

Coleman used her career to tour the country giving flight lessons, performing in flight shows, and encouraging African Americans and women to learn how to fly. In fact, she famously refused to speak at any events or locations that were segregated or that discriminated against African Americans. Americans and Europeans alike became fascinated by her performances and she became well known for her skill in completing various flying tricks.
"""

let MarieDaly = """
Marie Maynard Daly was born to a family that believed strongly in the power of education. Her father, Ivan C. Daly, emigrated from the West Indies in South America to the United States to study chemistry. He was unable to finish his degree due to a lack of funds, however, and found work as a postal clerk in New York. Daly's mother, Helen, spent long hours reading to her daughter, fostering Daly's love of books - especially science books.

After graduating from high school, Daly attended Queens College in Flushing, New York, choosing to live at home in order to save money. She then worked as a lab assistant at this college and earned a fellowship in order to help cover the costs of a graduate degree from New York University. Daly finished her master's degree in one year before enrolling at Columbia University as a doctoral student. After Daly finished her doctorate, she became the first female African American to receive a Ph.D. in chemistry in the United States.

In her years of research, Daly investigated the causes of heart attacks and, along with Dr. Quentin B. Demming, pioneered the discovery of the relationship between high cholesterol and clogged arteries. Daly further conducted studies on the effects of cigarette smoking on the lungs. Outside of research, Daly was influential in supporting efforts to enrol minority students in medical schools and graduate science programs and even started a scholarship for minority students who want to study science at Queen’s College.

let MaryJackson = """
Mary Jackson was born in Hampton, Virginia to Ella and Frank Winston. She attended Hampton’s all-black schools before going on to earn dual bachelor’s degrees in mathematics and physical science from Hampton Institute.

After college, Jackson worked as a teacher, bookkeeper and receptionist. In 1951, she was able to find a job with the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, NASA’s predecessor) as a research mathematician - a position known at the time as a "human computer." However, although discrimination in the defense industry was prohibited by federal law, Virginia state law still enforced segregation in the workplace. Not only did all work facilities have separate washrooms designated “white” or “colored”, but white workers could sit in a lunchroom to eat while workers of colour had to go back to their desks and eat. After several months of these unequal accommodations, Jackson considered resigning. Fortunately, her supervisor heard her complaints and invited her to work for him instead. Jackson was soon promoted to aeronautical engineer and developed expertise working with wind tunnels and analyzing data on aircraft flight experiments.

For nearly two decades, Jackson enjoyed a productive engineering career, authoring or co-authoring a variety of research reports on topics such as the behaviour of the boundary layer of air around airplanes. In 1979, she left engineering and took a demotion to become Langley’s Federal Women’s Program Manager. Although Jackson could no longer study in the field of aeronautics, she was able to make an important impact in the hiring and promotion of the next generation of all of NASA’s female mathematicians, engineers and scientists.

Rukhmabai was born to Janardhan Pandurang and Jayantibai. Rukhmabai’s father passed away when she was very young, and her mother remarried Dr. Sakharam Arjun, a doctor and a professor of botany at Mumbai’s Grant Medical College. Fortunately, Arjun was an advocate of education and social reform in India and supported Rukhmabai’s education.

At the age of eleven, Rukhmabai was married off to nineteen year old Dadaji Bhikaji, though she was able to continue living with her family. A few years later, however, Dadaji sent a legal notice to her family and Rukhmabai was ordered to go live with her husband or spend six months in jail. Rukhmabai was determined not to return to Dadaji and to continue her education, stating that she would rather face the maximum penalty than accept the verdict given. She wrote to Queen Victoria and the Queen overruled the court’s verdict, dissolving the marriage. This case became incredibly important in colonial India as it raised concerns on age, consent and choice for women in marriage.

After the case closed, she decided to study in England at the London School of Medicine For Women. After graduating and returning to India, she joined a hospital in Surat, declining an offer from Women’s Medical Service to join a state hospital. She served as the chief medical officer for thirty five years before retiring.

Ynes Mexia was born to a Mexican diplomat father, Enrique Mexia, and Sarah Wilmer. When Ynes was three years old, her father returned to Mexico City while her mother took Ynés and six of her siblings to Limestone County.

Decades later, at the age of 55, Mexía began her career as a botanist. She took a trip to western Mexico under the tutelage of Roxanna Ferris, a botanist at Stanford University, and over the next 12 years, she traveled to Argentina, Chile, Mount McKinley, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and the Straits of Magellan, and southwestern Mexico on seven different collecting trips.

Although she faced earthquakes, volcanoes, and a variety of other natural impediments, Mexia made a profound, lasting contribution to the field of botany. She not only discovered an entirely new genus, Mexianthus, but she also contributed to the finding of many new species among her 150,000 total samples. In fact, it is believed that approximately 500 of the plants she collected had previously been undiscovered. Several of the plants she discovered have now been named in her honor, and to this day, nearly a century later, scientists are still studying her work.

let RubyHirose = """
Ruby Hirose was born as part of the Nisei generation, a generation of Japanese-Americans that was raised with both the Japanese culture of their immigrant parents and the American culture of their surrounding public school system. Growing up in a predominantly white community, however, meant that Hirose often struggled with issues of racial identity and discrimination. Despite this, Hirose went on to earn bachelor’s and master’s degrees in pharmacology from the University of Washington before moving to the University of Cincinnati to complete her doctorate.

A few years later, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt ordered the relocation of people of Japanese ancestry living along the West Coast - this included Hirose’s father, brother and sister. Hirose had fortunately moved east and was living in Ohio by that time, however, there continued to be widespread discrimination against Japanese-Americans during this period.

Hirose nevertheless continued to contribute to important biochemistry research. For example, Hirose conducted research on hay fever, also known as pollen allergies, discovering ways to improve pollen extracts to desensitize hay fever sufferers such as herself. Hirose also published a paper on Hydrastis Canadensis, chronicling the history of the native North American plant and the history of its use in Indigenous communities. Hirose’s hard work ultimately made her one of the 10 women recognized by the American Chemical Society for her accomplishments in chemistry. She gave back to America even though fear mongering during the second world war held back so many of her relatives.

Mary Anning was born to Richard and Mary Anning in Lyme Regis, a town situated on the southern shores of Great Britain. Unfortunately, Richard died in 1810, leaving his family in debt and without a provider.

To sustain the family, Anning, her mother, and her brother sold fossils to collectors and scholars in the local community. Their fossil discoveries eventually attracted the attention of Lieut. Col. Thomas Birch, a fossil collector that not only purchased many of their specimens, but also held an auction and donated the proceeds to the family. This helped the Annings attract the business of even more collectors and scholars - the fossils that they found and prepared became eagerly sought not only by museums and scientists, but by European nobles with substantial private collections.

Despite her lack of formal scientific training, Anning’s keen eye, knowledge of the local Lyme Regis area, and skill at classifying fossils in the field earned her a strong reputation among the male dominated and largely upper-class ranks of paleontology. One of her most notable discoveries was of the first intact Plesiosaurus skeleton - in fact, it was so impressive that zoologist Georges Cuvier doubted the specimen’s size and state of preservation until he saw drawings of it in a paper by paleontologist William Daniel Conybeare. Following Cuvier’s authentication of the discovery, the scientific community began to recognize the paleontological value of Anning’s many fossil recoveries.

Elizabeth Garrett Anderson was born in Whitechapel, London, as the daughter of a pawnbroker with 12 children. Anderson was inspired to pursue medicine after meeting Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to graduate with a medical degree in the United States.

Anderson began her studies by enrolling as a nursing student at Middlesex Hospital and attending classes intended for male doctors, however, she was barred from continuing her courses after complaints from other students. Nevertheless, as it was not forbidden for women to take the examinations administered by the Society of Apothecaries, Anderson passed their exams and gained a certificate enabling her to become a doctor. This was, however, right before the society changed its rules to prevent other women entering the profession this way. Despite these many obstacles, Anderson remained determined to obtain a medical degree. She continued to persevere, teaching herself French and attending the University of Paris before successfully earning her degree.

Although the British Medical Register still refused to recognise her qualifications, Anderson founded the New Hospital for Women in London, an institution staffed entirely by women. She further helped found the London School of Medicine for Women and oversaw the school’s expansion after being appointed as dean. Anderson's determination helped pave the way for other women, ultimately leading to the introduction of women in medical professions in the United Kingdom.

Dorothy Hodgkin was born in Cairo, Egypt, where her father, John Winter Crowfoot, was working in the Egyptian Education Service. She became interested in chemistry and in crystals at about the age of 10, after which she fought hard to be allowed to join boys doing chemistry at school.

During the fourth year of her chemistry degree at Oxford, she completed a research project investigating the crystal structure of dimethyl thallium halides, a project that catalysed her career in crystallography. After graduating, Hodgkin completed a PhD in the crystallographic investigation of steroid crystals. It was during her PhD that Hodgkin first visited a consultant about pain in her hands. Swelling in the knuckle joints had caused her hand to become deformed, a condition for which her doctor prescribed rest. Hodgkin, however, put this off in order to finish some experiments. A few years later, an infection triggered Hodgkin’s first attack of rheumatoid arthritis. After a couple weeks at a specialist clinic, however, Hodgkin returned to the lab. Despite her hands being so affected that she could no longer use the main switch of the x-ray equipment required in her experiments, she carried on with her research undeterred.

Hodgkin was eventually awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for solving the atomic structure of important molecules such as penicillin and insulin using X-ray crystallography. Despite her worsening arthritis, Dorothy gave her time and expertise generously and enthusiastically and kept up a demanding global schedule for the rest of her life, using a wheelchair to move between conferences when walking became increasingly difficult and painful.

Her advisor, renowned physicist Otto Lummer, appointed her to the position of Assistant in 1914, making her one of just three women certified to teach physics at a German university before World War II. A few years later, however, she was removed from her university position due to her Jewish ancestry. Not long after, when it was clear that Kohn was not safe in the country, she secured a visa and a job teaching in America. Upon her arrival, Kohn became a professor first at the Women’s College of the University of North Carolina and then at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. After retirement, Kohn pursued independent research as a Research Associate at Duke University for twelve more years.

In both the earlier and later periods of her work, she worked in the field of quantitative measurement of the intensity of radiation, and contributed greatly to atomic and molecular spectroscopy, especially in work involving quantitative measurements of luminosity or temperature.
